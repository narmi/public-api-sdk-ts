_Example: "Add support for customizable timeout settings for API requests."_

## Problem Statement
_Describe the problem or limitation this feature would address. Include any specific pain points or challenges that motivated your request._

_Example: "Manually implementing a timeout on each request is possible but results in duplicated code and reduces code readability."_

## Potential Benefits
_Explain how this feature would improve the SDK, its usability, or the development experience for users. Consider including who would benefit most from this feature._

_Example: "Customizable timeouts would make the SDK more flexible for users with high-latency connections or specific response-time requirements."_
